               <p>
                    A cup is made with only 2 base ingredients - water and coffee, so getting these right is crucial. There are over 800 testing notes and potential flavourings to be found in coffee beans, so you have the opportunity to source coffee based on what you might be interested in. A fresh roast will always provide good results, so its recommended to buy your coffee as fresh as possible, and store in an air-tight container, ready for when you need it. Some good examples of great coffee vendors can be found <a href="#">here</a>.

                <p>
                    Water temperature and ingredients can also have a huge impact on the final product. The amount of minerals and chemicals can vary from country to country, and the less in your water, the better. Using a water filter to try to remove as much of these elements as possible is key to a good cup.
